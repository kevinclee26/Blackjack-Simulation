# Blackjack-Simulation
## Practical Python and Data Science Learning by buliding a Blackjack simulator

Ever wondered how much advantage the House has in Blackjack? This project creates a simulator and illustrates the results. Below are some interesting findings: 
-  On average: 
    -  a Player is dealt a 20 10% of the time, about the same as getting a 12 or 13. 
    -  a Player only has a ~50% chance of winning if dealt a 10 or 11, vs. a ~70% of winning if dealt a 20. That number drops if the player doubles down (gets only one card)
    -  a Player has <1% chance of pushing with the Dealer if dealt a 21.
